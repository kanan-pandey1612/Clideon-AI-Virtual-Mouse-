Clideon - AI Virtual Mouse
Clideon is an innovative AI-powered virtual mouse that enables hands-free control of your computer using advanced gesture recognition. Clideon allows users to move the mouse cursor, click, scroll, and interact with applications through hand gestures.

Features

Gesture Recognition: Control the mouse by detecting hand movements and gestures.

Task Automation: Perform system tasks like opening applications, checking the time, and more through gestures.

User-Friendly Interface: Easy to set up and use, designed for both technical and non-technical users.

Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works across multiple operating systems including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Technologies Used

Python: Core programming language for the project.

OpenCV: For hand and gesture tracking.

AutoSy: For simulating mouse movements and clicks.

How It Works

Gesture Control
Clideon uses OpenCV to track your hand movements through the webcam, allowing you to move the cursor by simply moving your hand. Gestures like clicking and scrolling are also recognized to simulate traditional mouse actions.

Mouse Control with AutoSy
AutoSy is used to simulate mouse events such as moving the cursor, left-clicking, right-clicking, and scrolling. This library is efficient for automating mouse control through gestures.

Usage
Launch Clideon by running the application.

Move your hand in front of the webcam to control the cursor.

Use gestures to interact with your system hands-free and enjoy a more intuitive computing experience!
